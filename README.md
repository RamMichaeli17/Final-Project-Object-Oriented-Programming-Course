The project is a paint program that stores the figures in an array and prints them to the screen , every figure has its own attributes.
There are functions that can be used on the figures to change their size , 
move them , delete them , and so on , and there's also mathematical functions that prints area and perimeter. 
There is also an option to "undo" and "redo" drawn shapes. The shapes can be saved to and loaded from a file.
